                <p class="author-detail"> <a class="filter" href=""><img src="Filter.png" alt="Filter" width="20px" height="20px"></a> Posted by <b>BeauHD</b> on Friday August 30, 2024 @06:00AM from the investing-in-the-future dept</p>
                <p class="main-article">Lego plans to make half of its bricks from renewable or recycled materials by 2026, with a goal of fully transitioning by 2032. While the company cites higher production costs and challenges 
                    with existing materials, it says it's committed to not passing these costs onto consumers.
                     The Guardian reports:</p>
                <p class="second-article">The Danish company last year ditched efforts to make bricks entirely from recycled bottles because of cost and production issues. At the moment, 22% of the material in its colourful bricks is not made from fossil fuels. The toymaker hopes gradually to bring down the amount of oil-based plastic it uses by paying up to 70% more for certified renewable resin, the raw plastic used to manufacture the bricks, in an attempt to encourage manufacturers to increase production. [...] Lego has also expanded its brick takeback programme, Replay -- where consumers can donate old bricks 
                    to the company through free shipping -- into the UK and continued to test similar models in the US and Europe.

                <p class="author-detail"> <a class="filter" href=""><img src="Filter.png" alt="Filter" width="20px" height="20px"></a> Posted by <b>BeauHD</b> on Friday August 30, 2024 @03:00AM from the investing-in-the-future dept</p>
                <p class="main-article">Astronomy researchers are urging the FCC to reconsider exempting large constellations of low Earth satellites from environmental reviews due to growing concerns over pollution, safety risks, and the impact on stargazing. They argue that the decades-old exemption is outdated, given the massive increase in 
                    satellite launches and potential long-term effects on the ozone, climate,
                     and environment. The Register reports: </p>
                <p class="second-article">Astronomers from Princeton University, University of California, Berkeley, and University of Arizona, among others, have added their names to a public letter that will be presented at some point to FCC space bureau chief Julie Kearney. The letter asks the FCC to follow prior recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which in 2022 issued a report calling for the telecom regulator to revisit its decision to exempt large constellations of satellites from environmental review.

                    The exemption was created way back in 1986, when far fewer satellites were being launched.
                     The GAO, however, urged the FCC to review the exemption, citing the recent proliferation of satellites 
                     and the questions that have been raised about the sustainability of the exemption. That recommendation was
                      recently echoed by US PIRG, which earlier this month made a similar request to the FCC. US PIRG notes that
                       the number of satellites in low Earth orbit has increased by a factor of 127 over the past five years, driven
                     largely by the deployment of mega-constellations of communications satellites from SpaceX's Starlink subsidiary.

                <h2 class="article-title">Feds Bust Alaska Man With 10,000+ CSAM Images Despite His Many Encrypted Apps <a href="#"></a></h2>
                <p class="author-detail"> <a class="filter" href=""><img src="Filter.png" alt="Filter" width="20px" height="20px"></a> Posted by <b>BeauHD</b> on Friday August 29, 2024 @01:50AM from the investing-in-the-future dept</p>
                <p class="main-article">A recent indictment (PDF) of an Alaska man stands out due to the sophisticated use of multiple encrypted communication tools, privacy-focused apps, and dark web technology. "I've never seen anyone who, when arrested, had three Samsung Galaxy phones filled with 'tens of thousands of videos and images' depicting CSAM, all of it hidden behind a secrecy-focused, password-protected app called 'Calculator Photo Vault,'" writes Ars Technica's Nate Anderson. "Nor have I seen anyone arrested for CSAM having used all of the following: [Potato Chat, Enigma, nandbox, Telegram, TOR, Mega NZ, and web-based generative AI tools/chatbots]." An anonymous reader shares the report: </p>
                <p class="second-article">According to the government, Seth Herrera not only used all of these tools to store and download CSAM, but he also created his own -- and in two disturbing varieties. First, he allegedly recorded nude minor children himself and later "zoomed in on and enhanced those images using AI-powered technology." Secondly, he took this imagery he had created and then "turned to AI chatbots to ensure these minor victims would be depicted as if they had engaged in the type of sexual contact he wanted to see." In other words, he created fake AI CSAM -- but using imagery of real kids.

                    The material was allegedly stored behind password protection on his phone(s) but also on Mega and on Telegram, where Herrera is said to have "created his own public Telegram group to store his CSAM." He also joined "multiple CSAM-related Enigma groups" and frequented dark websites with taglines like "The Only Child Porn Site you need!" Despite all the precautions, Herrera's home was searched and his phones were seized by Homeland Security Investigations; he was eventually arrested on August 23. In a court filing that day, a government attorney noted that Herrera "was arrested this morning with another smartphone -- the same make and model as one of his previously seized devices."
                    
                    The government is cagey about how, exactly, this criminal activity was unearthed, noting only that Herrera "tried to access a link containing apparent CSAM." Presumably, this "apparent" CSAM was a government honeypot file or web-based redirect that logged the IP address and any other relevant information of anyone who clicked on it. In the end, given that fatal click, none of the "I'll hide it behind an encrypted app that looks like a calculator!" technical sophistication accomplished much. Forensic reviews of Herrera's three phones now form the primary basis for the charges against him, and Herrera himself allegedly "admitted to seeing CSAM online for the past year and a half" in an interview with the feds.</p>
